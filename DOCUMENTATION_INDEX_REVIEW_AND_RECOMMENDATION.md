# DOCUMENTATION INDEX REVIEW & STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATION

## 1. Is DOCUMENTATION_INDEX_2026-06-19.md sufficient for now?
**Yes.** While the repository root contains numerous scattered validation logs and audit files from earlier sessions, the presence of the `DOCUMENTATION_INDEX_2026-06-19.md` file establishes a clear, authoritative map. Any competent developer (or AI agent) reading the index will be immediately directed to the locked architecture schemas and the current `README_FIRST.md`, allowing them to safely ignore the noise of deprecated audit files. The cognitive debt is mitigated through strict navigation rather than structural deletion.

## 2. Should documentation restructuring be performed now or deferred?
**Deferred.** Executing a mass migration of 30+ files into nested folders (`docs/audits/`, `docs/reports/`, etc.) generates significant Git noise and introduces the risk of breaking internal markdown hyperlinks right before entering a heavy implementation phase. Because the newly created Index effectively isolates the noise, restructuring yields diminishing returns at this exact moment and should be deferred until Phase 10 is completed as part of a final Phase 10 Handover cleanup.

## 3. Highest-Value Next Activity
**Choice:** `C. Question Registry Implementation`

**Justification:** The Question Registry architecture (Phase 9) is 100% mathematically and structurally documented. The schemas (`QUESTION_REGISTRY_MASTER_v1.md`, `QUESTION_REGISTRY_MAPPING_v1.md`) are complete and ready for code translation. Implementing the backend `FormulaLoader` and `QuestionID Router` unlocks the immediate capability of the mathematical engines to process deterministic queries. Proceeding with UI blueprints (B) before the backend API contract for the router is built may lead to frontend rework. Moving to Implementation (C) drives immediate product value and validates the Phase 9 architecture in practice.

## 4. Governance & Architectural Risks Before Proceeding
1. **Fallback Logic Risk:** During the Question Registry implementation, the NLP (free-text) mapping mode MUST NOT accidentally bypass the strict domain schemas if it hallucinates an invalid `question_id`. A strict fail-safe dictionary check must exist on the backend router.
2. **LLM Synthesis Boundary Risk:** As `QuestionEngine.compose_response` is refactored to support Registry endpoints, it must be strictly constrained from fabricating astrological rules. It should only format the deterministic booleans passed by the new Registry schema.
3. **Engine Isolation Protection:** The creation of the `FormulaLoader` must remain external to the locked mathematics (D1, Varga, Dashas). The formulas evaluate the output of the engines; they must never attempt to recalculate the base layers.
