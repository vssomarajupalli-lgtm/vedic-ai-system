# PHASE 10C: IMPLEMENTATION READINESS AUDIT

## 1. CONSISTENCY VERIFICATION

1. **UI Blueprint Consistency:** **PASS.** The mobile-first Accordion design aligns perfectly with the 24 Master Domain hierarchy.
2. **Registry Consistency:** **PASS.** `QUESTION_REGISTRY_MASTER_v1.md` clearly defines the nodes, and `QUESTION_REGISTRY_MAPPING_v1.md` establishes the necessary boolean trigger schemas (`timing_required`, etc.).
3. **Router Consistency:** **PASS.** `QUESTION_ROUTER_CONTRACT_v1.md` maintains strict mathematical boundaries, extracting only necessary formulas and shielding base engines from LLM interference.
4. **Backend Contract Consistency:** **PASS.** The `/ask-question` endpoint schema accounts for strict `question_id` requests as well as free-text payload injections.
5. **Search Behavior Consistency:** **WARNING.** The UI flow suggests real-time DOM filtering ("UI filters the 200+ list instantly"), while the Backend Contract defines a server-side Search Dictionary Layer. *Undefined behavior:* It is unclear if fuzzy search runs in the React client state or requires a `GET /search` API call.
6. **Favorites Consistency:** **PASS.** Bound to `localStorage` client-side.
7. **Recent Questions Consistency:** **PASS.** Bound to `localStorage` client-side with a 10-item retention limit.
8. **Free-text Fallback Consistency:** **PASS.** Explicit routing logic cleanly drops NLP tasks if no 80% confidence match is found against the Master Registry.
9. **Question ID Hierarchy Consistency:** **PASS.** The payload schema properly handles string-based `question_id` mapping.
10. **Governance Compliance:** **PASS.** Explicit preservation of `DashaEngine`, `TransitEngine`, and `NatalPromiseEngine` immutability.

## 2. IDENTIFIED RISKS & MISSING ELEMENTS

### Contradictions
- **Search Execution Layer:** As noted above, there is a minor contradiction between the UI blueprint (implying client-side instant search filtering) and the Backend Contract (implying server-side NLP dictionary mapping).

### Missing Fields / Mappings
- **Question Definition Storage Format:** The architecture does not specify whether the 200+ child questions will be stored in a `.yaml` file, a `.json` file, or a SQL database during backend implementation.
- **Formula Parsing Engine:** The `QUESTION_REGISTRY_MAPPING_v1.md` maps questions to required engines, but the actual mathematical formulas (e.g., "Score > 50 = Good") need a specific parser inside the Router.

### Undefined Behaviors
- **Missing Variable Handling:** If a question requires `active_mahadasha` but the user's birth data causes the `DashaEngine` to fail execution earlier in the pipeline, what is the exact fallback text the LLM should generate?

---

## 3. BLOCKERS

### Critical
- *None.* The architectural boundaries are perfectly safe.

### High
- **Storage Format Decision:** Must decide exactly how the Registry is persisted (JSON file vs YAML config vs SQLite) before coding the `FormulaLoader`.

### Medium
- **Search Execution Boundary:** Decide if keyword filtering is a React array filter or a FastAPI endpoint. (Recommendation: Static JSON loaded into React state for instant client-side filtering).

### Low
- **Error Copywriting:** Define the exact string to return when NLP fallback fails the 80% confidence check.

## 4. IMPLEMENTATION READINESS SCORE
**Score:** `92 / 100`

## 5. FINAL RECOMMENDATION
**READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION**
The core mathematical safety locks hold firm. The identified blockers are standard tactical implementation decisions (JSON vs YAML, Client vs Server search) that can be seamlessly resolved during the active coding phase without threatening the underlying Vedic AI System architecture.
