# PHASE 9 DOCUMENTATION GOVERNANCE UPDATE REPORT

## Overview
The Phase 7 Handover package contained a legacy `README_FIRST.md` reflecting an earlier snapshot of the codebase. Given the significant advancements across Phase 8 (Frontend & Reporting integration) and Phase 9 (Question Engine Governance), the `README_FIRST.md` document has been formally promoted and updated to act as the current, authoritative entry point for any agent resuming operations on the repository.

## Actions Completed
- **Rewrote `README_FIRST.md`**: Fully replaced legacy mathematical locking boilerplate with an up-to-date Phase 9 context header.
- **Section 1: Current Project Status**: Confirmed Phase 9 completion and readiness for the Phase 10 Question Engine implementation.
- **Section 2: Phase 8/9 Retrospective**: Highlighted UI integration and critical Dasha API boundary bug fixes.
- **Section 3: Development Priorities**: Laid out Phase 10A, 10B, and 10C targets.
- **Section 4: Question Registry Authority**: Explicitly linked `QUESTION_REGISTRY_ARCHITECTURE_v1.md`, `QUESTION_REGISTRY_MASTER_v1.md`, and `FORMULA_REPOSITORY_GOVERNANCE` as indisputable specs.
- **Section 5: Gochara Governance**: Formalized the deferral of complex Transit timeline extrapolation, noting that current implementations use stateless snapshots.
- **Section 6: Naming Conventions**: Formalized timestamp suffixes and versioning logic.
- **Section 7: Protected Engine List**: Re-asserted strict immutability bounds for `DashaEngine`, `NatalPromiseEngine`, `PipelineRunner`, and others.
- **Section 8: Roadmap**: Outlined the explicit transition to YAML parsing, Question ID routing, and UI overhaul.

## Code Impact
Zero code impact. Purely architectural and documentation mapping.

## Next Steps
Agents assuming context should now rely exclusively on `README_FIRST.md` for project orientation, followed by the Question Registry documents to execute Phase 10 implementation safely.
