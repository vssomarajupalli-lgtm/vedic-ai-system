# PHASE 9 STEP 3A: GOVERNANCE PACKAGE REPORT

**Date:** 2026-06-19_1130

## Purpose
This document serves as the implementation report for Phase 9 Step 3A: Question Engine Governance Package. The objective was to produce a strictly documentation-only architectural blueprint for the Question Engine, securing the logic abstractions and pipeline flow before any Python implementation begins.

## Files Created
The following documents were generated in `docs/question_engine/`:

1. `QUESTION_ENGINE_INDEX_2026-06-19_1130.md`
2. `QUESTION_ENGINE_ARCHITECTURE_2026-06-19_1130.md`
3. `QUESTION_LIBRARY_MASTER_2026-06-19_1130.md`
4. `MASTER_LIFE_ANALYSIS_QUESTIONS_2026-06-19_1130.md`
5. `QUESTION_ROUTER_DESIGN_2026-06-19_1130.md`
6. `ANSWER_COMPOSER_DESIGN_2026-06-19_1130.md`
7. `TIMING_ENGINE_DESIGN_2026-06-19_1130.md`
8. `FORMULA_REPOSITORY_DESIGN_2026-06-19_1130.md`

## Files Modified
1. `docs/README_FIRST.md` - Added reference to the `docs/question_engine/` Governance Package under the architecture section.

## Governance Summary
* **Code Isolation:** **PASS**. Zero Python code or engine execution logic was modified.
* **Separation of Concerns:** **PASS**. The architectural blueprint successfully separates the Query (Router) from Logic (Formula Repository) from Chronology (Timing Engine) from Presentation (Answer Composer).
* **Future Readiness:** **PASS**. The `TIMING_ENGINE_DESIGN` and `QUESTION_ENGINE_ARCHITECTURE` correctly scaffold the future insertion point for Gochara, Ashtakavarga, and Mandali integrations.
* **Hardcoding Prevention:** **PASS**. `FORMULA_REPOSITORY_DESIGN` strictly forbids hardcoded astrology rules inside Python execution code, pushing rule evaluation to an externalized format.
