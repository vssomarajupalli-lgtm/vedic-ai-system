# PHASE 13B: FORMULA EVALUATOR ARCHITECTURE REPORT

## 1. Objective Met
Successfully designed the architecture for the `FormulaEvaluator`, the critical junction that bridges raw engine calculations with the generative Answer Composer. This phase strictly adhered to the "No Implementation" mandate while establishing impenetrable boundaries against astrological hallucination and computational duplication.

## 2. Architectural Deliverable
**FORMULA_EVALUATOR_ARCHITECTURE_v1.md** was created, defining:
- **Responsibilities:** The Evaluator acts as a "dumb consumer," extracting data and resolving logic gates without executing any math.
- **Evaluation Flow:** Outlined the strict sequence from Engine Extraction to Confidence Layer boolean resolution.
- **Graceful Degradation:** Established the protocol for capping results at `MIXED` if a required engine (like `TransitEngine`) fails, mitigating systemic outages.
- **Missing Payload Handling:** Defined strict null-checks for extracted signals to prevent the LLM from inventing missing planetary data.
- **Integration Boundary:** Defined the rigid structure of the `FormulaEvaluationResult` payload passed to the LLM (containing only isolated signals, final state, and template key).

## 3. Governance Verification
The architecture successfully passed all verification checks:
- **Never perform astrology calculations:** YES. Logic is entirely boolean extraction and matrix resolution.
- **Never duplicate engine logic:** YES. Relying entirely on extracting nodes from `ChartProcessResponse`.
- **Never introduce hidden scoring systems:** YES. Resolution relies on logical `AND`/`OR` gating (Fatal Denials vs. Positive Alignment) rather than arbitrary numeric weights.

Phase 13B is complete. The conceptual blueprint for translating raw engine math into safe, deterministic logic gates is ready for implementation in Phase 13C.
