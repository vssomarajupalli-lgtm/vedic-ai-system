# PHASE 11C: FASTAPI QUESTION ROUTER INTEGRATION REPORT

## 1. Objective Met
Successfully integrated the Phase 11B Question Router into the `v1/endpoints/queries.py` FastAPI logic. The `/ask-question` endpoint now dynamically processes deterministic `question_id` lookups while fully preserving backward compatibility for legacy NLP string searches.

## 2. API Contract Modifications
- **Modified File:** `backend/app/schemas/question.py`
- **Updates:** 
  - `question_text` is now marked as `Optional[str]`.
  - Added `question_id: Optional[str]` to the inbound `QuestionRequest` payload.
  - Added `resolved_question_id: Optional[str]` to the outbound `QuestionResponse` payload.

## 3. Router Integration Logic
- **Modified File:** `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/queries.py`
- **Execution Flow:** 
  - **Validation:** Safely rejects with `HTTP 400` if both `question_text` and `question_id` are absent.
  - **Interception:** If `question_id` is present, it routes through the `QuestionRouter`.
  - **Error Propagation:** Handles router `error` statuses securely, surfacing `HTTP 422` (Unprocessable Entity) for malformed or non-existent IDs, and `HTTP 500` for catastrophic JSON registry configurations.
  - **Fallback Context Injection:** If a user submits *only* a `question_id` without typing text, the endpoint fetches the `question_name` from the registry metadata and injects it downstream so the PipelineRunner LLM still has semantic context (e.g., "Marriage Timing").

## 4. Integration Test Coverage
- **Location:** `backend/tests/test_fastapi_question_router.py`
- **Tests Implemented:**
  - `test_ask_question_with_valid_id`: Mocks the engine response and verifies that an incoming `question_id` is correctly routed, mapped, and returns a 200 OK.
  - `test_ask_question_with_invalid_id`: Verifies safe 422 HTTP interception.
  - `test_ask_question_missing_both_id_and_text`: Verifies basic 400 Bad Request checking.
  - `test_ask_question_legacy_free_text`: Ensures the endpoint continues to function perfectly when old clients pass raw text without IDs.
- **Execution Status:** 4/4 Integration Tests PASSED via pytest.

## 5. Strict Governance Maintained
As explicitly requested, the `PipelineRunner`, `QuestionEngine`, and all mathematical core engines remained 100% untouched during this API exposure phase. The integration serves exclusively as a secure interceptor and normalizer at the API boundary.
