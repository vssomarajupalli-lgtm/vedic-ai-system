# PHASE 13D: ANSWER COMPOSER ARCHITECTURE REPORT

## 1. Objective Met
Successfully designed the architecture for the Answer Composer. This layer acts as the final presentation boundary, safely transforming the deterministic `FormulaEvaluationResult` into natural language without executing any astrological logic itself. No code or implementation files were created, adhering strictly to the Phase 13D blueprint constraints.

## 2. Deliverables Created
**ANSWER_COMPOSER_ARCHITECTURE_v1.md** was created, defining:
- **Responsibilities:** The Composer translates boolean truths into human-readable prose and strictly enforces tonal boundaries dictated by the Evaluator.
- **Input/Output Contracts:** It consumes only the isolated `FormulaEvaluationResult` and generates a `ComposerResponse` containing Markdown strings.
- **Hallucination Controls:** The architecture forces the LLM into a formatting role by utilizing "Tone-Locking" and "Bounded Evidence" prompt instructions. The LLM is mathematically blind.
- **Template Resolution:** It pairs the `answer_template_key` with the `final_state` to rigidly select the appropriate foundational prompt before LLM generation begins.

## 3. Governance Verification
The architecture successfully passed all verification checks:
- **Consume FormulaEvaluationResult only:** YES. The raw chart payload is blocked at the Evaluator boundary.
- **Never calculate astrology:** YES. The LLM is given no planetary longitudes or mathematical tools.
- **Never create hidden logic:** YES. All conditional pathways are resolved upstream in the Evaluator.
- **Never override Formula Evaluator results:** YES. The "Tone-Locking" mechanism explicitly commands the LLM to adopt the pre-calculated `final_state`.

## 4. Architectural Challenge Resolution
During design, an ambiguity was identified regarding how missing engine data (`system_warnings`) should be communicated to the user.
- I presented two alternatives: Generative (having the LLM explain the failure) vs. Deterministic (hardcoding the warning block after generation).
- I recommended the **Deterministic** approach (Alternative B) because relying on the LLM to communicate system failures invites hallucination and violates our mandate for explicit determinism.

Phase 13D is complete. The system's blueprint for safely communicating mathematical truths via Generative AI is fully defined.
