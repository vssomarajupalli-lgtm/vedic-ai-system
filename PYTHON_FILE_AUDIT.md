## 2. Canonical Execution Path Verification

The system execution strictly processes stateless payload data through the following layers:

```mermaid
graph TD
    Source[canonical_content.json + machine_index.json]
    Normalizer[app/parsers/json_normalizer.py]
    Pipeline[app/pipeline_runner.py]
    Engines[Planet / House / Yoga / Varga / Dasha / Rasi / Ashtakavarga / Transit Engines]
    Master[app/engines/master_probability_engine.py]
    NatalPromise[app/engines/natal_promise_engine.py]
    ReportBuilder[app/reports/builder.py]
    API[api/v1/endpoints/reports.py]
    Frontend[Frontend Upload / Results Pages]

## 3. Findings

### A. Active Files That Must Remain
All files marked as `ACTIVE` in Section 1 are integral to the system. These include:
- The REST API framework (`main.py`, `api/v1/router.py`, and all endpoints).
- The normalization layer (`json_normalizer.py`).
- The sequential execution engine (`pipeline_runner.py`).
- The 11 computation engines (Planet, House, Yoga, Varga, Dasha, Rasi, Ashtakavarga, Transit, Natal Promise, Master Probability, and Question engines).
- The human-readable reporting layer (`reports/builder.py`, `reports/schemas.py`, and the concrete section extractors).

### B. Files Safe to Archive
The following files are obsolete and safe to delete or move to `backend/app/archive_legacy_pdf_pipeline`:
- **`app/parsers/index_reader.py`** (Legacy PDF TOC parser)
- **`app/parsers/pdf_text_extractor.py`** (Legacy PDF text extractor)
- **`app/parsers/table_parser.py`** (Legacy PDF table parser)
- **`debug/debug_pdf_extract.py`** (Legacy PDF extractor CLI runner)
- **`tests/debug_pdf_extract.py`** (Empty 0-byte duplicate script)

Additionally, **`app/engines/quality_metrics_engine.py`** is not imported or consumed in the production runtime, only in tests. It should be archived.

### C. Files Requiring Manual Review
- **`app/api/v1/endpoints/queries.py`**: Contains code that calls the QuestionEngine incorrectly.
- **`app/reports/sections/extractors.py`**: Attempts to fetch `"current_dasha"` from the pipeline's `"dashas"` output, which is keyed by planet names instead.

### D. Duplicate/Conflicting Implementations
1. **PDF Parsers vs JSON Loader**:
   `index_reader.py`, `pdf_text_extractor.py`, and `table_parser.py` use `pdfplumber` to extract tables and text directly from PDF. This directly conflicts with the system rule that **Vedic-AI must NEVER parse PDFs directly** and represents a legacy duplicate implementation of data ingestion.
2. **Question Engine API Call Mismatch**:
   - `QuestionEngine.answer()` has a single definition in `backend/app/engines/question_engine.py` with signature:
     `def answer(self, question: str, pipeline_output: dict) -> dict`
   - In `backend/run.py` (CLI), it is called correctly as:
     `ans = q_engine.answer(q, output)` (returning a dictionary).
   - In `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/queries.py` (FastAPI), it is called incorrectly as:
     ```python
     answer, used_yogas = question_engine.answer(
         question=request.question_text,
         chart_results=request.engine_outputs
     )
     ```
     This triggers:
     - `TypeError`: due to the unexpected keyword argument `chart_results` (instead of `pipeline_output`).
     - `ValueError`: due to trying to unpack a tuple of 2 from a dictionary return value containing 8 keys.
3. **Dasha Section Extractor Key Mismatch**:
   - `app/reports/sections/extractors.py` (line 58) attempts to retrieve the active dasha:
     `dasha = pipeline_data.get("engine_outputs", {}).get("dashas", {}).get("current_dasha", {})`
   - However, the pipeline runner's `"dashas"` output is a dictionary mapping planet names to their activation flags (e.g. `{"saturn": {"temporal_activation": ...}}`). It does not contain a `"current_dasha"` key.
   - This causes the report executive summary to fall back to `"Unknown-Unknown Dasha"` on all outputs.

### E. Suspected Source of Current Runtime Issues (The "Fixed 48 Score" Bug)
* **Root Cause Found**:
  When the pipeline processes a payload where the keys `planets`, `houses`, `vargas`, `dashas`, and `ashtakavarga` are empty or missing, the engines fall back to their neutral baseline (`50.0` points) for all factors except Ashtakavarga's SAV support (which has no baseline and defaults to `0`).
  
  The weighted sum of these defaults inside the `NatalPromiseEngine` computes as:
  `raw_score = 0.95 * 50.0 = 47.5`
  
  Applying rounding (`round(47.5)`) yields exactly **`48`** with a grade of **`WEAK`** for every single domain (Marriage, Career, Wealth, Education, Children, Property, Health, and Spirituality).
  
* **Why it happens in the browser**:
  When tested programmatically via `pytest` and `run.py`, the pipeline processes `RAJU_CANONICAL_RAW` or the file `canonical_content.json` correctly and outputs the true dynamic scores (`19 / 62 / 57 / 26` etc.).
  
  However, in the web interface, if the user uploads files that are either empty, missing, or have their keys wrapped inside a parent structure (such that `raw_data.get("planets")` and `raw_data.get("raw_planets")` both return `None`), the normalizer filters them out, feeding empty dicts into the engines. This triggers the fallback default of 48 across all domains.
