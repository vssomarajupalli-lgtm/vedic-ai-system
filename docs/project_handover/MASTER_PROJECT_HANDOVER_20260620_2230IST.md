# MASTER PROJECT HANDOVER

**SNAPSHOT DATE:** 2026-06-20
**SNAPSHOT TIME:** 22:30 IST

## A. Executive Summary
The Vedic AI System has successfully completed Phase 14G. The core probability architecture (Question Engine) is strictly decoupled from Transit computations (Mandali), ensuring lightning-fast execution and absolute adherence to Parashari astrological principles. The test suite of 670 tests passes perfectly with 0 degradation.

## B. Project Mission
To build a highly deterministic, API-driven astrological calculation engine capable of predicting natal promise and granular timing using classical Parashari principles without black-box AI hallucination.

## C. Current Architecture
*   **Layer 1:** Natal Promise Engine (Truth Layer)
*   **Layer 2:** Dasha Engine (Activation Layer)
*   **Layer 3:** Question Engine (Promise + Dasha Probability Matrix)
*   **Layer 4:** Mandali Engine (Independent Transit Advisory Layer)

## D. Current Formula Coverage
*   11 Distinct Astrological Domains
*   11 Base Families
*   33 Special Variants (44 total schemas)

## E. Current Registry Coverage
*   Question mapping architecture supports N:1 mapping (Many Question IDs -> 1 Formula Key).
*   Timing queries are permanently decoupled from `future_gochara_required`.

## F. Current Governance State
*   `ASTROLOGICAL_PREDICTION_GOVERNANCE_v1` is permanently frozen.
*   `PHASE15_MANDALI_DECOUPLING_DECISION_RECORD` is permanently frozen.
*   Mandali cannot alter Question Engine probability scores.

## G. Current Testing State
*   **Status:** GREEN
*   **Test Count:** 670
*   **Coverage:** 100% on core components.

## H. Current GitHub State
*   Working tree clean. All changes committed.

## I. Completed Phases
Phase 13G through Phase 14G.

## J. Pending Phases
*   Phase 15: Mandali Engine Independent Implementation
*   Phase 16+: Real Case Chart Validations

## K. Future Roadmap
*   Build out the LLM Answer Composer to ingest JSON blocks from both the Question Engine and Mandali Engine simultaneously to weave highly contextual narrative predictions.
*   Expand Question Coverage to 500+ Canonical Questions.

## L. Critical Decisions
*   **Mandali Decoupling:** Transit data is permanently separated from Boolean probability math.
*   **Formula Inheritance:** Question Schemas follow strict Object-Oriented inheritance (Base -> Variant).

## M. Known Risks
*   **Data Consistency:** Pratyantardasha (PD) accuracy is heavily dependent on exact birth time data; error margins must be communicated to the end user.

## N. Recommended Next Action
Bootstrap a new AI agent using the Handover Prompt (File 09) and initiate Phase 15.
