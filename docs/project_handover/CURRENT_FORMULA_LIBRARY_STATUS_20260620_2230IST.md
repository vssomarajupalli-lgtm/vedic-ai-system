## Future Expansion Strategy
The Formula Library is architecturally complete. No new python architectural models are required. 
Future expansion simply requires adding new mapping entries into `question_registry.json` and appending new `FormulaSchema` definitions into `registry_data.py` utilizing the exact same established pattern.
