# PHASE COMPLETION HISTORY
**Document State:** Final (Phase 7 Lockdown)
**Date:** 2026-06-17

## Phase 1: Parsing Foundation
* **Goal:** Defensively parse raw astrology PDFs using index-driven page boundaries.
* **Major Deliverables:** `IndexReader`, `PdfTextExtractor`, and initial table boundary logic.
* **Key Files:** `app/parsers/index_reader.py`, `app/parsers/pdf_text_extractor.py`
* **Completion Status:** COMPLETED
* **Architectural Impact:** Established the rule that raw PDF parsing must be isolated from engine calculations.

## Phase 2: Normalization Layer
* **Goal:** Convert parsed PDF structures into strict, safe JSON payloads.
* **Major Deliverables:** `JsonNormalizer`, schema validation, missing data fallback defaults (score=50).
* **Key Files:** `app/parsers/json_normalizer.py`, `app/models/`
* **Completion Status:** COMPLETED
* **Architectural Impact:** Created a firewall preventing malformed or missing data from crashing the mathematical engines. Introduced Dosha passthrough.

## Phase 3: Strength Engines
* **Goal:** Calculate deterministic strengths for planets (Graha) and houses (Bhava).
* **Major Deliverables:** Planet Strength Engine, House Strength Engine, PipelineRunner integration.
* **Key Files:** `app/engines/planet_strength_engine.py`, `app/engines/house_strength_engine.py`, `app/pipeline_runner.py`
* **Completion Status:** COMPLETED
* **Architectural Impact:** Formalized the Engine Isolation Principle and the core D1 foundational math.

## Phase 4: Varga & Validation
* **Goal:** Integrate structural capacity modifiers without mutating D1.
* **Major Deliverables:** Varga Engine, complete test suite for legacy payload wrapping.
* **Key Files:** `app/engines/varga_engine.py`, `tests/`
* **Completion Status:** COMPLETED
* **Architectural Impact:** Enforced the D1 Immutability Principle. Vargas serve strictly as modifiers.

## Phase 5: Natal Promise
* **Goal:** Synthesize deterministic foundational rules (Yogas, Functional Nature) to establish base predictions.
* **Major Deliverables:** Natal Promise Engine, Yoga Engine, Functional Nature Engine, Question Engine flow.
* **Key Files:** `app/engines/natal_promise_engine.py`, `app/engines/yoga_engine.py`, `app/engines/question_engine.py`
* **Completion Status:** COMPLETED
* **Architectural Impact:** Mapped domain scoring directly to specific life events without AI interpolation.

## Phase 6: Dasha Integration
* **Goal:** Provide time-based timing multipliers based on Vimshottari principles.
* **Major Deliverables:** Dasha Engine, standardized Timeline Array contract.
* **Key Files:** `app/engines/dasha_engine.py`
* **Completion Status:** COMPLETED
* **Architectural Impact:** Established standard JSON timeline contracts for chronological frontend rendering.

## Phase 7: Mandali Gochara Migration
* **Goal:** Implement micro-precision transit tracking by shifting from Rasi bounds to absolute Mandali bounds.
* **Major Deliverables:** Mandali Generator, upgraded Transit Engine, Sade Sati 12/1/2 logic, complete 613/613 test coverage.
* **Key Files:** `app/engines/mandali_generator.py`, `app/engines/transit_engine.py`
* **Completion Status:** COMPLETED
* **Architectural Impact:** Locked the interpretation engine but massively upgraded the boundary precision for timing snapshots.
