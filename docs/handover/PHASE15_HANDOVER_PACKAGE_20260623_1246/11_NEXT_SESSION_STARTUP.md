# 11_NEXT_SESSION_STARTUP

Welcome to the Vedic AI System project. This document provides the exact sequence you should follow to orient yourself and resume development seamlessly.

## 1. Initial Reading Order
Please read the following documents sequentially to gain the necessary context:

1. **PROJECT_STATUS_MASTER.md** *(Located in the root or main docs folder)* - This gives the high-level original project charter.
2. **SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md** *(Located in the root or main docs folder)* - To understand the overall technical ecosystem.
3. **docs/reference/PROMISE_ENGINE_FORMULA_v1.md** - This is the holy grail for scoring logic.
4. **docs/validation/PHASE_15_PROMISE_ENGINE_VALIDATION.md** - Validates the successful implementation of the formula.
5. **This Entire Handover Package:** Read `01_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md` through `10_LESSONS_LEARNED.md` to understand exactly what was completed right before this session began.

## 2. Verification Steps
After reading, perform the following checks before writing any new code:

* **Verify Runtime:** Run `python backend/run.py` to ensure the core execution pipeline operates without fatal errors.
* **Verify Dataset:** Check `backend/run.py` to confirm it is still loading `raju_canonical_content.json`.
* **Verify Architecture:** Read `backend/app/engines/natal_promise_engine.py` to familiarize yourself with the 35/30/20/15 pillar splits.

## 3. Continuing Development
Once verified, proceed to **09_PENDING_WORK.md**.
The highest priority task is **P1 Formula Validation Audit** (fixing the 88 failing unit tests to align with the new percentage-based boundaries).

Good luck.
