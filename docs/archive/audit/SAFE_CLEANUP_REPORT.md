# SAFE_CLEANUP_REPORT.md

## Safe Cleanup Phase Report
This report details the execution and verification of the Safe Cleanup Phase, archiving legacy PDF-parsing files and verifying system stability.

---

## 1. Summary of Actions

### A. Files Moved
The following legacy PDF-parsing files and debug utilities have been successfully archived to `backend/archive_legacy_pdf_pipeline/`:
- `backend/app/parsers/index_reader.py` → `backend/archive_legacy_pdf_pipeline/index_reader.py`
- `backend/app/parsers/pdf_text_extractor.py` → `backend/archive_legacy_pdf_pipeline/pdf_text_extractor.py`
- `backend/app/parsers/table_parser.py` → `backend/archive_legacy_pdf_pipeline/table_parser.py`
- `backend/debug/debug_pdf_extract.py` → `backend/archive_legacy_pdf_pipeline/debug_pdf_extract.py`

### B. Files Deleted
- `backend/tests/debug_pdf_extract.py` (Unused 0-byte duplicate script deleted)

---

## 2. Verification Results

### A. Unit Tests Passed
The active test suite was executed, ignoring the legacy tests corresponding to the archived parsers:
- **Command Run**: `pytest tests/ --ignore=tests/test_index_reader.py --ignore=tests/test_pdf_text_extractor.py --ignore=tests/test_table_parser.py`
- **Result**: **`606 passed in 0.69 seconds`** (100% success rate, no regressions)

### B. FastAPI Application Startup Passed
The application startup was verified by invoking the FastAPI application using the `TestClient` to perform a health check:
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/v1/health/`
- **Response Status**: `200`
- **Response Body**: `{"status": "online", "service": "Vedic-AI Core API"}`
- **Diagnostic Log**:
  ```log
  Starting Vedic-AI Core API...
  Health check ping received.
  Health Check Response Status: 200
  Health Check Body: {'status': 'online', 'service': 'Vedic-AI Core API'}
  ```

## 3. Impact Assessment
- **Zero Impact on Production Runtime**: Because no imports in active code, FastAPI, or PipelineRunner were modified, and the archived files were not imported in the active tree, the application remains fully stable.
- **Improved Code Quality**: Removed 5 dead or obsolete files from the core app directory tree, resolving duplicate parsing routes and adhering to the "Vedic-AI must NEVER parse PDFs directly" rule.
