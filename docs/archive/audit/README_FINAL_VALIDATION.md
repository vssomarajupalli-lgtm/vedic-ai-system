# README_FINAL_VALIDATION

**Final Result**: FAIL

## Exact Corrections Required

### 1. Contradictory Project Goals (Lines 200-201)

* **Line 200**: `8. Calculates Dasha Activation`
* **Line 201**: `9. Calculates Natal Promise`

**Why it fails**: These lines directly contradict the Primary Authority document `ARCHITECTURE_RULES.md` (Section 13: CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION BOUNDARY), which explicitly places "Dasha systems" and "Probability synthesis systems" (Natal Promise) under the "FUTURE roadmap phases" and dictates that "These are NOT current implementation priorities."

**Correction**: 
Remove lines 200 and 201 to align the current project goal with the established boundaries in `ARCHITECTURE_RULES.md`.

### 2. Inaccurate Development Priorities (Lines 206-226)

* **Lines 206-226**: Defining `V1 Completion` to include 10 new astrological features (`V1.1 Foundation Upgrade` and `V1.2 Domain Upgrade` with Upapada Lagna, Moolatrikona, Combustion, etc.).

**Why it fails**: This priority list directly contradicts both the `ARCHITECTURE_RULES.md` and the `VEDIC-AI SYSTEM – PROJECT HANDOVER STATUS (June 2026).md`. 
1. `ARCHITECTURE_RULES.md` strictly mandates (Rule 15: DEVELOPMENT DISCIPLINE) that the team must "first stabilize: extraction, normalization, deterministic scoring, testing" and that "Correctness is more important than rapid feature expansion."
2. The Handover Status states the architecture is only ~80% complete and explicitly mandates the absolute priority: "Core unresolved issue: Real horoscope data is not yet proven to flow correctly... The next session must begin with runtime proof, not further theory." Expanding 10 new astrological features is exactly the "theory" forbidden by the Handover Status until the core pipeline runs flawlessly.

**Correction**: 
Remove lines 206-226. Replace the "CURRENT DEVELOPMENT PRIORITY" section with the priority defined in the Handover Status: establishing runtime proof and stabilizing the core mathematical pipeline data flow for the existing engines.
