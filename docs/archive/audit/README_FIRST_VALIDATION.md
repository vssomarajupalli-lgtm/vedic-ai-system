# README_FIRST_VALIDATION

## Task 1: Verify all file paths exist
**Result: FAILED**
Validating paths relative to the `docs/` directory:
* `VEDIC_AI_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.md` (Valid)
* `VEDIC-AI SYSTEM – PROJECT HANDOVER STATUS (June 2026).md` (Valid)
* `ARCHITECTURE_RULES.md` (Valid)
* `reference/VEDIC_AI_MASTER_ARCHITECTURE.md` (Valid)
* `reference/PROJECT_REQUIREMENTS.md` (Valid)
* `reference/VEDIC_AI_MASTER_DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md` (Valid)
* `reference/VEDIC_AI_PROBABILITY_ENGINE_ARCHITECTURE.md` (Valid)
* `reference/VEDIC_AI_VERSION_1_RELEASE.md` (Valid)
* `docs/archive/*` (**Broken**: Relative to the `docs/` directory, this path translates to `docs/docs/archive/*`. It should just be `archive/*`).
* `CHATGPT_IMPLEMENTATION_MEMORY.md` (Valid)
* `CHATGPT_ARCHITECTURE_MEMORY.md` (**Broken**: File exists in `archive/`, not at the root of `docs/`).
* `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` (**Broken**: File exists in `archive/` and `reference/`, not at the root of `docs/`).
* `PROJECT_STATUS_MASTER.md` (**Broken**: File exists in `archive/`, not at the root of `docs/`).
* `SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md` (Valid)

## Task 2: Verify no references to specific obsolete documents/terms
**Result: FAILED**
The document explicitly references the forbidden terms in the "DO NOT USE FOR IMPLEMENTATION" section:
* Line 93: `* CHATGPT_IMPLEMENTATION_MEMORY.md`
* Line 96: `* PROJECT_STATUS_MASTER.md`
* Line 99: `These documents contain earlier project assumptions, PDF-extraction architecture, obsolete implementation plans...`

## Task 3: Verify reading order is correct
**Result: PASSED**
The reading order under "PRIMARY AUTHORITY (Mandatory)" correctly lists the three essential files that define the baseline truth for the current phase:
1. `VEDIC_AI_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.md`
2. `VEDIC-AI SYSTEM – PROJECT HANDOVER STATUS (June 2026).md`
3. `ARCHITECTURE_RULES.md`

## Task 4: Verify PRIMARY AUTHORITY section is consistent with current repository state
**Result: PASSED**
The section correctly identifies the 3 active documents that dictate the current constraints, explicitly separating them from the premature/hallucinated "Design References" and placing them at the top of the authority hierarchy. This exactly matches the verified state of the repository.

## Task 5: Verify no broken links
**Result: FAILED**
While there are no formal markdown hyperlinks (e.g., `[text](url)` syntax), the raw text file paths listed in the "DO NOT USE FOR IMPLEMENTATION" section are functionally broken paths when resolved against the `docs/` working directory, as identified in Task 1.
