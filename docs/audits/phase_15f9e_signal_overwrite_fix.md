# Phase 15F.9E – Signal Extraction Overwrite Fix

## 1. Objective
Implement the minimal fix to prevent `FormulaEvaluator.extract_signals()` from accidentally overwriting previously collected rich dictionary payloads (e.g., from `PlanetStrengthEngine`) with primitive integer values generated deep inside other engine payloads (like Ashtakavarga BAV modifiers). This definitively resolves the `AttributeError: 'int' object has no attribute 'get'` crash occurring in `DisplayFormatter`.

## 4. Implementation Details
The problematic `found.update(find_keys(...))` recursion blinded merged all overlapping keys found deeper in the output payload tree. The fix introduces an inline `safe_set(k, v)` merge helper. If `k` is already present inside `found` as a `dict`, and the incoming `v` is a primitive scalar (like `int` or `float`), it safely skips the overwrite assignment. This natively protects core `{"final_score": ...}` structural objects mapped early in the JSON extraction path while remaining non-destructive to regular `get` operations.

## 5. Regression Verification
- **Question Engine Execution**: A batch execution invoking `/ask-structured-question` across all registered questions was completed against `RAJU_CANONICAL_RAW`. All endpoints successfully passed and successfully extracted formatting payloads without the `AttributeError`.
- **Supporting Factors & Attention Factors**: Successfully regenerated using the protected isolated signal dictionaries. (e.g. `['Venus provides strong support (63/100).', '7th House provides strong support (54/100).', ...]`).
- **Engine Tests**: Back-end `pytest` suite tests continue to pass correctly, reflecting identical original scoring states (5 classical chart calibration expectations maintained as failures; zero system crashes).
- **Formula Verification Console**: Unaffected, backend breakdown outputs remain 100% structurally identical.
