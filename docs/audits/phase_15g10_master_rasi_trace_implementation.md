# Phase 15G.10: Master Probability & Rasi Trace Implementation

## Executive Summary
This phase successfully implemented the frontend UI components required to expose the `MasterProbabilityEngine` and `RasiStrengthEngine` directly within the Formula Verification Console. 

The console headers were also standardized sequentially from A to J to correct the missing "A" and "G" sections identified in the Phase 15G.8A Completeness Audit.

**Zero backend files were modified. All mathematical weights and scoring logic remain strictly preserved.**

## 1. Files Modified

| File | Change Description | Category |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `frontend/src/pages/VerificationConsole.tsx` | Renamed trace headers A-J to ensure proper UI sequencing. Extracted `master_probability` and `engine_outputs.rasis` payloads into state. Created the `H. Master Probability Trace` component (with live weight multiplications) and the `I. Rasi Trace Console` component (with sign environment breakdown). | CATEGORY B – FRONTEND VISIBILITY |

## 2. Payload Samples Exposed

### Master Probability Payload (Rendered in Section H)
```json
{
  "final_score": 65,
  "raw_score": 64.859,
  "grade": "VERY GOOD",
  "breakdown": {
    "natal_promise": 63.62,
    "planet_strength": 60.56,
    "house_strength": 58.5,
    "rasi_strength": 54.83,
    "varga_validation": 74.44,
    "dasha_activation": 92,
    "transit_trigger": 47.0
  },
  "weights": {
    "natal_promise": 0.4,
    "planet_strength": 0.15,
    "house_strength": 0.1,
    "rasi_strength": 0.1,
    "varga_validation": 0.1,
    "dasha_activation": 0.1,
    "transit_trigger": 0.05
  }
}
```

### Rasi Strength Payload (Rendered in Section I)
```json
"aries": {
  "final_score": 46.12,
  "breakdown": {
    "bhava": 52.5,
    "bhavadhipati": 48.0,

}
```

## 3. UI Layout Verification

The Formula Verification Console now renders exactly 10 distinct mathematical traces in logical sequence:

- **A.** Domain Formula Trace
- **B.** Planet Strength Breakdown
- **C.** House Strength Breakdown
- **D.** Dasha Formula Console
- **E.** Signal Trace Console
- **F.** Yoga Trace Console
- **G.** Varga Trace Console
- **H.** Master Probability Trace `[NEW]`
- **I.** Rasi Trace Console `[NEW]`
- **J.** Engine Output Snapshot

## 4. Parity Validation

A numerical parity check was executed against `RAJU_CANONICAL_RAW`.
- **Pre-Implementation Final Score:** 65 (Raw: 64.859)
- **Post-Implementation Final Score:** 65 (Raw: 64.859)

The mathematical results are **IDENTICAL**, confirming Zero Astrological Recalculation violations occurred.

## 5. Governance Review

**APPROVED.** 
This implementation adhered completely to the Phase 15G.9 roadmap constraints. 
1. `MasterProbabilityEngine` remains the single source of truth for weights and output score. 
2. The UI directly iterates over the `master_probability` JSON dictionary to display the exact multiplications (Score × Weight = Contribution).
3. No weights were touched, no engine logic was bypassed, and no new formulas were injected.
