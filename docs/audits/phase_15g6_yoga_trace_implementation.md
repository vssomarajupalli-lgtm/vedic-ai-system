# PHASE 15G.6: Yoga Trace Implementation Report

## Objective
Implement Yoga Trace transparency by augmenting the existing `YogaEngine` to evaluate and return detailed Trace Objects (capturing rules, pass/fail status, and failure reasons), whilst perfectly preserving legacy string array formats (`universal_yogas`, `house_1_yogas`, etc.) required for upstream system backward compatibility.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. `backend/app/engines/yoga_engine.py` (Refactored)
- `evaluate()` has been updated to initialize `results["yoga_traces"] = {}` alongside the existing arrays.
- Implemented `_build_trace()` helper to uniformly process rules, determine `status` (`PASSED`/`FAILED`), and extract the `failure_reason`.
- **Governance Maintained**: The existing logic array population was retained. Yogas are only appended to `universal_yogas` and house-specific arrays if their underlying Trace object evaluates to `"PASSED"`.
- Refactored all 22 yoga detection stubs (e.g. `_detect_gaja_kesari_yoga`, `_check_mahapurusha`) to unconditionally evaluate all condition clauses and return a standardized dictionary matching the Trace Schema instead of early-exiting booleans.

### 2. `frontend/src/pages/VerificationConsole.tsx`
- Injected a new expandable trace component: **"H. Yoga Trace Console"**.
- This section targets the live data stream `breakdown.engine_outputs.yogas.yoga_traces`.
- Iterates over all evaluated yogas, displaying their status badges. For both passed and failed yogas, the full rule evaluation set is displayed with `[✓]` or `[✗]` boolean indicators. Failed yogas uniquely display their `failure_reason` in a highlighted alert block.

## Regression Summary
- **Mathematical Governance Intact**: Zero modifications were made to `astrology_constants.py`, `PlanetStrengthEngine`, `HouseStrengthEngine`, `NatalPromiseEngine`, or `MasterProbabilityEngine`. `YogaEngine` retains its status as a strict detection layer.
- **Data Shape Preservation**: Tests prove that `universal_yogas` and `house_x_yogas` still return perfectly flat arrays of string names, preventing regressions in downstream consumption.
- **Frontend Validation**: A local `npm run build` confirmed zero type errors or rendering conflicts with the newly embedded `H. Yoga Trace Console` component.
- **Backend Validation**: `pytest tests/test_yoga_engine.py` passes 100% after test-level accommodations were made to expect the new `yoga_traces` dictionary inside the root response.

## Status
Ready for user acceptance and subsequent git commit.
