# Phase 15F.9B - Dasha Timeline Regression Fix

## Objective
Fix the regression introduced during Phase 15F.9 (`AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'get'`) while preserving the timeline rescue functionality in `dasha_results`.

## Implementation Details
Replaced the blind list conversion of `dasha_results.values()` with a defensive list comprehension that explicitly filters for dictionary types `if isinstance(e, dict)`. This guarantees that the `next()` generators running `e.get("confidence_flags")` will strictly operate on planet dictionary payloads and inherently skip the `timeline` list (and any future primitive metadata added to the dasha payload) without stripping it from the larger `engine_outputs`.

## Test Results
1. **Question Engine Evaluation**: Successfully ran `ask_structured_question` over all `question_registry.json` elements against `RAJU_CANONICAL_RAW`. All questions generated valid `QuestionResultCard` structs safely without throwing exceptions.
2. **Backend Engine Tests**: Ran `pytest tests\test_real_charts.py`. The suite returned exactly 5 failures (which match the known classical calibration failures from prior phases) and 25 passes in 0.17s. The `TypeError` / `AttributeError` exception is resolved.

## Build Results
- Build successful. 
- Existing scores unchanged.
- Timeline remains preserved and passes smoothly to the frontend Question Result formatting layer.
- Question Engine operates seamlessly.
