# Phase 15G.8A: Verification Console Completeness Audit

## Executive Summary
This audit evaluates the current state of the Formula Verification Console to determine if all deterministic engines and subsystems are visibly exposed for mathematical proof.

**Console Completeness Percentage:** ~65%
**Remaining Transparency Backlog:** 6 Subsystems
**Status:** Incomplete. Several critical math engines remain hidden and the UI headers are currently disjointed.

---

## 1. Mislabeled & Missing Headers

The current React render labels are out of sync:
- **Missing "A":** The code comment states `A. Domain Formula Trace`, but the UI renders `B. Domain Formula Trace`.
- **Missing "G":** The UI jumps straight from `F. Signal Trace Console` to `H. Yoga Trace Console`. Section G is completely skipped.

## 2. Section by Section Review

### Domain Trace
- **Current Status:** EXPOSED (Mislabeled as B)

### Planet Trace
- **Current Status:** EXPOSED (Labeled as C)
- **Data Source:** `breakdown.engine_outputs.planets`

### Varga Trace
- **Current Status:** EXPOSED (Labeled as I)
- **Data Source:** `breakdown.engine_outputs.vargas`
- **Missing Fields:** None.
- **Backend Dependency:** `VargaEngine`

### Engine Snapshot
- **Current Status:** EXPOSED (Labeled as J)
- **Data Source:** `breakdown` (Entire JSON payload)
- **Missing Fields:** None.
- **Backend Dependency:** `PipelineRunner`

## 3. Remaining Transparency Gaps (NOT EXPOSED)

The following deterministic engines exist in the backend and actively generate scored output payloads, but are **completely hidden** from the Verification Console.

1. **Ashtakavarga Trace (`ashtakavarga`)**
   - *Hidden:* BAV and SAV matrices are computed but invisible.
2. **Rasi Strength Trace (`rasis`)**
   - *Hidden:* Sign strength scores and their `bhava`/`bhavadhipati` mathematical breakdowns are invisible.
3. **Transit Trace (`transit`)**
   - *Hidden:* Gochara activation triggers are computed but invisible.
4. **Functional Nature Trace (`functional_nature`)**
   - *Hidden:* The determination of whether a planet acts as a malefic or benefic for a specific ascendant is invisible.
5. **Master Probability Synthesis (`master_probability`)**
   - *Hidden:* The exact weighted synthesis blending all the above engines into the final predictive score is missing from the console trace view.
6. **Calibration Constants**
   - *Hidden:* Base weights, neutral defaults, and grade boundaries (identified in Phase 15G.8) are hardcoded and invisible.

## 4. Recommended Next Phase

**Phase 15G.8B – Verification Console UI Alignment & Gap Closure**
1. Correct the alphabetical headers to be sequential (`A` through `M`).
2. Add **Ashtakavarga Trace Console** (to expose SAV/BAV).
3. Add **Rasi Trace Console** (to expose Sign environments).
4. Add **Transit Trace Console** (to expose Gochara triggers).
5. Add **Functional Nature Trace Console** (to expose specific planetary roles).
6. Add **Master Synthesis Console** (to expose Master Probability mathematics).
7. Add **Calibration Console** (to expose immutable engine constants).
