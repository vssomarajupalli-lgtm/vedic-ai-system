# PHASE 11B: ROUTER IMPLEMENTATION REPORT

## 1. Objective Met
Successfully implemented the Question Router logic (`QuestionRouter`) wrapping the Phase 11A `QuestionRegistryLoader`. This module acts as the safe translation layer between incoming UI IDs and internal mathematical formula keys.

## 2. Implemented Components

### 2.1 The Router Core: `QuestionRouter`
- **Location:** `backend/app/core/question_router.py`
- **Capabilities:**
  - Standardizes error handling by returning structured dictionaries (`{"status": "error", "error_type": "...", "message": "..."}`) rather than throwing raw Exceptions that could crash the API.
  - Automatically hooks into the existing `QuestionRegistryLoader` initialized in Phase 11A.
  - Extracts and formats the exact payload needed by downstream modules: `registry_record`, `formula_key`, and mathematical requirement `metadata`.

### 2.2 Validation Safeties
- **Malformed Input:** Detects if `question_id` is passed as `None`, an empty string, or an integer, returning a `malformed_question_id` error.
- **Missing Entry:** Safely handles requests mapping to deleted or non-existent IDs, returning a `missing_registry_entry` error instead of a `KeyError`.
- **Duplicate Propagation Defense:** If the underlying JSON registry is corrupted (duplicate keys), the Router catches the exception during initialization and locks down the route, returning a `registry_configuration_error` to all requests until the config is fixed.

### 2.3 The Testing Layer: `test_question_router.py`
- **Location:** `backend/tests/test_question_router.py`
- **Coverage:**
  - `test_router_valid_question_id`: Baseline path validation.
  - `test_router_missing_question_id`: Tests the safety wrapper for non-existent IDs.
  - `test_router_malformed_question_id`: Validates type checking.
  - `test_router_handles_duplicate_registry_safely`: Proves the Router won't crash the server if the JSON becomes corrupted.
  - **Integration Test:** `test_integration_router_resolves_full_chain` proves the end-to-end lookup: ID (`10.2`) -> Record -> Formula Key (`CAR_CHANGE_001`).
- **Execution Status:** 5/5 PASSED.

## 3. Strict Governance Preserved
All mathematical calculation layers were strictly preserved. No modifications occurred inside `engines/`, `models/`, or `pipeline_runner.py` during this phase.

## 4. Next Step Implementation (Phase 11C Recommendation)
The Question Router is complete and mathematically insulated. The next immediate step is to expose this router through the FastAPI endpoints (e.g., modifying `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/queries.py`) so the frontend can securely POST `question_id` requests.
