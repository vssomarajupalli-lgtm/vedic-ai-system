# PHASE 11D: SEARCH LAYER IMPLEMENTATION REPORT

## 1. Objective Met
Successfully implemented the `SearchLayer` module. This provides a safe, deterministic bridge between ambiguous free-text NLP queries and the strict `QuestionRouter`. By mapping unstructured user intent into known Domain IDs and subsequently generating a list of candidate `question_id` strings, the system eliminates hallucination risks before hitting the math engines.

## 2. Implemented Components

### 2.1 The Search Dictionary & Resolver: `SearchLayer`
- **Location:** `backend/app/core/search_layer.py`
- **Capabilities:**
  - **Search Dictionary:** Pre-configured with common aliases, synonyms, and misspellings mapping to specific Registry Domains (e.g., "marrage" -> Domain 7, "job" -> Domain 10).
  - **Text Normalization:** Automatically strips punctuation, lowercases input, and tokenizes queries into evaluable strings.
  - **Domain Resolution:** When a query hits a domain dictionary trigger (like "career"), it iterates through the Phase 11A `question_registry.json` and harvests all child `question_id` strings belonging to that domain.

### 2.2 Validation Safeties
- **Empty Query:** Returns a safe `empty_search` object.
- **Unknown Keyword:** Returns a safe `unknown_keyword` object if the user types something outside the current dictionary (e.g., "car").
- **Multiple Domain Conflicts:** If a user submits an overly broad query spanning distinct domains (e.g., "Will my job give me money?", hitting Career and Wealth), the layer safely aborts with `multiple_domain_matches` rather than guessing intent.

### 2.3 The Testing Layer: `test_search_layer.py`
- **Location:** `backend/tests/test_search_layer.py`
- **Coverage:**
  - `test_search_keyword_match`: Validates direct dictionary keyword matching.
  - `test_search_alias_match`: Validates synonymous string matching.
  - `test_search_misspelling_match`: Validates typo tolerance.
  - `test_search_unknown_keyword`: Proves the resolver cleanly rejects hallucinated domain concepts.
  - `test_search_multi_match_keyword`: Enforces the single-domain constraint logic.
  - **Integration Test:** `test_integration_search_to_router` successfully validates the target end-to-end traversal: *Free Text -> Search Layer -> ID Extraction -> Question Router -> Formula Key Delivery*.
- **Execution Status:** 7/7 PASSED.

## 3. Strict Governance Preserved
The Search Layer acts independently in the frontend-facing orchestration pipeline. `PipelineRunner`, `DashaEngine`, `TransitEngine`, and all mathematical calculators remained completely untouched. The pipeline mathematically isolates NLP operations perfectly.
