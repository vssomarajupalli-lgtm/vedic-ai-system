# PHASE 13C: FORMULA EVALUATOR IMPLEMENTATION REPORT

## 1. Objective Met
Successfully implemented the `FormulaEvaluator` to isolate engine extraction and boolean resolution from the LLM, adhering strictly to the governance mandates of Phase 13B.

## 2. Implementations Completed

### 2.1 FormulaEvaluationResult Schema
Updated `schema.py` to include `FormulaEvaluationResult`. This solidifies the rigid boundary payload consisting exclusively of:
- `final_state` (FAVORABLE, MIXED, UNFAVORABLE)
- `isolated_signals`
- `answer_template_key`
- `system_warnings`

### 2.2 Engine Extraction & Boilerplate
Implemented `FormulaEvaluator.extract_signals()` in `evaluator.py`. It traverses the massive `ChartProcessResponse` dict and dynamically isolates only the precise astrological variables requested in the formula's `required_signals` array.

### 2.3 Graceful Degradation Logic
Implemented `FormulaEvaluator.check_engine_degradation()`. It validates the incoming payload against the `required_engines` mapping. If an engine (e.g., `TransitEngine`) fails to supply data, it forces the `is_degraded` state and appends a structured `system_warning`.

### 2.4 Boolean Condition Resolution
Implemented the `evaluate()` method which acts as the core logical matrix. 
- It tracks `fulfilled_layers` against `total_layers` based purely on logical presence mapping.
- It degrades seamlessly if an engine warning touches a required transit or dasha layer.
- Resolves the state directly to `FAVORABLE` (≥ 80%), `MIXED`, or `UNFAVORABLE` (≤ 20%). If degraded, the ceiling is forced to `MIXED`.

## 3. Unit Testing Validation
Created and passed `test_formula_evaluator.py` (5/5 tests passing). 
- Tested nested payload extraction matching keys exactly.
- Tested simulated missing transit payloads successfully triggering degradation to `MIXED`.
- Tested the missing signal fallback (Risk-FR-05) appending proper warnings and adjusting state.
- Tested perfect alignment successfully triggering `FAVORABLE`.

## 4. Governance Assurances
- **Consume engine outputs only:** Yes. It maps and checks dict keys.
- **Zero planetary/dasha/transit calculations:** Yes. No math modules or date checks are executed.
- **Zero scoring algorithms:** Yes. Resolution relies entirely on boolean percentage thresholds and strict matrix overrides (degradation states).

Phase 13C is functionally complete. The system can now safely extract, evaluate, and package data for the generative layer.
