# PHASE 9 RECONCILIATION AUDIT

## 1. COMPLETED WORK
The following items have been fully resolved, implemented, and validated across Phase 8 and Phase 9:
- **Phase 8 PDF Export Fix:** Corrected WeasyPrint HTML payload handling.
- **Report Data Completeness:** Ensured all nested block dependencies extract safely.
- **Client Profile Completion:** Frontend properly passes dynamic user data into the payload.
- **Report Dasha Visibility:** `extractors.py` and `base.html` explicitly surface `active_md`, `active_ad`, `active_pd`.
- **Question Engine Dasha Visibility:** Fixed the `ChartProcessResponse` payload nesting bug in `queries.py` to ensure `QuestionEngine` receives valid Dasha synthesis dictionaries.
- **Question Registry Architecture:** Drafted `QUESTION_REGISTRY_ARCHITECTURE_v1.md` pivoting to a rigid 24-Domain mathematical lookup structure.
- **Question Registry Data Model:** Authored `QUESTION_REGISTRY_MASTER_v1.md` and `QUESTION_REGISTRY_MAPPING_v1.md`.
- **README_FIRST Modernization:** Rewrote the entry-point README to explicitly reflect Phase 9 completion and Phase 10 trajectory.

## 2. PENDING WORK

### High Priority
- **Question Registry API Implementation (Phase 10A & 10B):** Write the `FormulaLoader` and `QuestionID Router` to intercept incoming `question_id` payloads and execute the specific formula mappings.
- **Question Browser UI (Phase 10C):** Overhaul the React UI `QuestionEngine.tsx` to feature the 24-Master-Domain collapsible menu.

### Medium Priority
- **Documentation Migration:** Migrate the 30+ scattered `PHASE8_` and `PHASE9_` markdown documents generated in the root folder into an organized `/docs/` taxonomy.

### Future Priority
- **Mandali Gochara Extrapolation:** Move transit computations from static snapshots to dynamic timeline boundaries.
- **Prashna & Synastry Extensions:** Add distinct architectural layers for Horary and Compatibility evaluations.
- **Ashtakavarga Confidence Weighting:** Dynamically invoke Kakshya boundaries for real-time Gochara timing checks.

## 3. GOVERNANCE CONSISTENCY CHECK
- **Question Registry Architecture:** CONSISTENT. Defines the deterministic routing paradigm.
- **Question Registry Mapping:** CONSISTENT. Properly applies the architecture schema to child nodes.
- **README_FIRST:** CONSISTENT. Up to date with the latest Phase 9 state.
- **Protected Engine Rules:** CONSISTENT. `DashaEngine` and others remain unedited and mathematically locked.
- **Gochara Deferral:** CONSISTENT. Formally marked via `future_gochara_required` mapping.
- **Mandali Governance References:** CONSISTENT.
- **D1 Immutability:** CONSISTENT.
- **Engine Isolation:** CONSISTENT. Confirmed during the `queries.py` UI-fix which maintained engine boundary separation.

## 4. README_FIRST REVIEW
- **Evaluation:** The newly updated `docs/HANDOVER_PACKAGE_2026-06-17_PHASE7_FINAL/README_FIRST.md` precisely reflects the shift to Phase 10 and enforces all mathematical locks.
- **Decision:** **KEEP**.

## 5. STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATION
**Recommendation:** A (Documentation Index Cleanup)
**Justification:** The project root currently houses over 20+ scattered tracking reports, audits, and governance schemas (e.g., `PHASE9_STEP2C...md`, `QUESTION_REGISTRY...md`, `README_FIRST_PHASE9_UPDATE_REPORT.md`). Before initiating Phase 10 backend implementations and creating new code, moving these files into the planned `docs/` hierarchy will eliminate cognitive debt, clearly define the "Source of Truth" for the `FormulaLoader` implementation, and secure the repository structure for handovers.
